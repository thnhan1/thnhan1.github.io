# How I use Obsidian and organize notes
Adjust according to your experience—there are no standard rules; notes are for your convenience. This approach is referenced from the CEO of Obsidian.

## Personal rules
- Avoid dividing content into multiple vaults.
- Avoid using folders for note organization.
- Avoid using non-standard Markdown: for portability, import/export.
- Limit multiple categories and tags.
- Prioritize using internal links.
- Use YYYY-MM-DD format everywhere.
- Use a 7-point scale for ratings.
- Keep one simple to-do list each week.

The purpose is to maintain a consistent writing style for future note consolidation and to increase focus and organization. Unused notes and duplicate notes will be ineffective, so following principles is important.

## Folders and organization 
- **Few or no folders:** because many notes can relate to multiple different fields, forcing them into one folder loses flexibility.
- **No nested sub-folders:** avoid thinking "which folder is this note in?". Reduces overhead.
- **Don't use file explorer much:** don't use the folder tree but use *Quick Switcher* (`Ctrl+O`), or use backlinks and links to navigate to related notes.
- Organize notes by `categories` instead of folders.
- Use **Base** to display note overview similar to Notion's database view.

## Folders
2 main folders include:
- **References**: Where to place personal notes. Examples: books, movies, people, podcasts. Name them in title format `Book title.md`.
- **Clippings**: notes from others, collected using clip plugin.

3 personal folders include:
- **Attachments**: images, audio, videos, PDFs.
- **Daily**: for daily notes. Following syntax `YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- **Templates**: for templates.

2 folders serving as base (overview location for notes).
- **Categories:** top-level overview of each type of note (e.g.: Books, Movies).
- **Notes:** contains example notes and tips I collect.

## Ratings

Add a property called `ratings`: If you're the type of person who likes to score things, now:
- 7 — **Perfect**, top of the peak, life-changing, must crawl to get there
- 6 — **Excellent**, so good you want to come back again
- 5 — **Good**, no need to break your neck running there, but worth it
- 4 — **Passable**, decent enough, better than nothing
- 3 — **Bad**, if there's another way, avoid it
- 2 — **Atrocious**, run when you see it, terrifying as hell
- 1 — **Evil**, life-changing in a catastrophic direction

## Templates
Do you find those ratings above strange? That's because I'm using the style of noting everything down—you're someone with short-term memory, now, noting down even people you just met, colleagues, restaurants, dishes, drinks, hence those ratings. Reference nearly [100 templates from the CEO](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian). I keep it simple with light evaluation.
