## Wednesday – February 11, 2026. A bad day is not a bad life

This morning my motorbike tire went flat, so I had to book a ride to work. In the afternoon, I found out the tire had been punctured by a twisted screw nail stuck inside. There are only two days left before I can take a break for Lunar New Year (27th day of the lunar calendar).

## Friends

I have a very good friend who used to be my leader in one of my courses. I asked him a few questions about my current job, and he answered very enthusiastically and explained everything in detail. I feel lucky to have friends like that.

## I feel like the worst one in my high-school IT team.

My seniors in the group work at places like NAB, SAP, or other large companies. I also joined a big company, but in a low-level position. I feel inadequate, but at the same time I know I’m lucky because I used to be one of them. They worked very hard to get where they are today.

## I will try harder

Financially, in my family, and in my relationship, I don’t have any major burdens. That is something I should consider myself lucky for. So tomorrow I need to try harder and also work on my habit of worrying about things that are not my responsibility. I need to stop meddling in matters that could bring trouble to myself.
